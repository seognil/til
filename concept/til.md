# Today I Learned Til

Til is a fast record system of daily study.

Maybe I should try it for improving my dev skills.

> Today I learned that no matter how much experience, skill, or education someone has, they are always learning nifty little things every day.
> It's a pretty great thing that I have learned today.

## Simple analyze of others's til

Simply make an organization:

- PL
- web and JS ecosystem
- python ecosystem
- network backend and db
- unix cli, os, software trick

it reminds me that:

> I don't think you can be a professional in the computing industry knowing just one language. If you actually want to be in the field, you should learn at least 2 preferably 5, maybe a few more. —— Bjarne Stroustrup
> [Bjarne Stroustrup - The Essence of C++](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86xWVb4XIyE)

Just keep learning computer science and make some epic shit.
